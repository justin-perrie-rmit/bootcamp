# 🎓 Bootcamp Simulation Experiment (RMIT)

The **Bootcamp Simulation Experiment** is a web-based environment designed for RMIT students to explore programming concepts through natural, conversational learning.  
It focuses on simulating social interaction in a classroom-style setting, where virtual students (NPCs) respond and adapt to player engagement.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This experiment studies how students learn programming — specifically Ruby — when lessons are delivered in a social, conversational format rather than traditional instruction.  

Players interact with NPC classmates who each have unique personalities, teaching styles, and relationship states. As conversations progress, the tone and familiarity evolve naturally, creating an immersive and dynamic learning environment.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🎮 **Conversational NPCs:** Virtual classmates who act like real peers, not assistants.  
- 💬 **Dynamic Tone & Relationship System:** NPC dialogue adapts from polite to personal as familiarity grows.  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Ruby Programming Topics:** Covers Ruby fundamentals including variables, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.  
- 🧪 **Experimental AI Logic:** Personality and tone logic designed for social learning research.  
- 🌐 **Web-Based Interface:** Built with Express.js and EJS templates for easy deployment.  

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (EJS templates)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js / Python LLM 
- **Logic Engine:** Custom conversation system using adaptive tone and personality layers  
- **Hosting:** Compatible with GitHub Pages, AWS EC2, and local development

## 🚧 Status
This project is currently an **academic experiment** and is **not intended for production use**.  
It serves as part of a research exploration into interactive education and simulated peer learning.

---

## 🧭 Future Directions
- Expansion into group interactions between multiple NPCs  
- Additional lesson topics and adaptive challenges  
- Integration with data collection for engagement and learning behavior research
